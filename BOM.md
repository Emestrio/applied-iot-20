Bill of materials for the course in Applied IoT (Till√§mpad IoT) @ Linnaeus University 2020.

If you have any questions, please let me know and I'll update the BOM. My contact details: [fredrik @ LNU](https://lnu.se/en/staff/fredrik.ahlgren/).


## From Pycom.io

* [LoPy4 (With headers)](https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/)
* [Expansion board 3.0](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/)
* [LoRa/SigFox antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lora-868mhz-915mhz-sigfox-antenna-kit/)

You will get **20 % off your order** from Pycom with the code provided by mail when you registered to the course.

## What you also need is:

* Micro USB cable (*high quality, you probably already have some lying around*)

- Sensors of your choice. I recommend a starting kit from either [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-aufger%C3%BCsteter-Sensormodul-Bausatz-Anleitung/dp/B01M30ZWQR/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=sensor+kit+arduino&qid=1583957059&sr=8-5) for ~30 EUR, or from Swedish distributor [Kjell.com](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/el-verktyg/arduino/moduler/playknowlogy-stora-modul-paketet-for-arduino-p87291)

Wiring and breadboards:

- [Starting kit for Arduino](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/el-verktyg/arduino/arduino-kit/luxorparts-basic-start-kit-for-arduino-p90632) from Swedish distributor or [breadboard(s)](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-Breadboard-Solderless-Distribution-Verbindungsbl%C3%B6cke/dp/B01MCRZFE5/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3L86WOJGVV8CB&keywords=breadboard&qid=1583957299&sprefix=breadboard%2Caps%2C282&sr=8-3) and [Dupont cables](https://www.amazon.de/Female-Female-Male-Female-Male-Male-Steckbr%C3%BCcken-Drahtbr%C3%BCcken-bunt/dp/B01EV70C78/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=dupont+cable&qid=1584042669&sr=8-3) from amazon.



## Choice of LTE and NB-IoT

If you want LTE as well, the FiPy4 is the way to go (in that case, replace LoPy4 with FiPy). It's a bit more expensive, but does the same thing as LoPy4 with added benefit of LTE/NB IoT as well.

- [FiPy](https://pycom.io/product/fipy/) 
- [Expansion board 3.0](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/)
- [LTE antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lte-m-antenna-kit/), 
- [LoRa/SigFox antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lora-868mhz-915mhz-sigfox-antenna-kit/),
